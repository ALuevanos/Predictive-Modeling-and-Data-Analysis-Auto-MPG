# Predictive-Modeling-and-Data-Analysis-Auto-MPG
This project explores predictive modeling and data analysis with the Auto MPG dataset, featuring data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning models to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG). It demonstrates techniques like feature selection, regression analysis, and model evaluation.


# 🚗 Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis: Auto MPG 🛠️

Welcome to the **Auto MPG Project**, where I explored predictive modeling and data analysis using the Auto MPG dataset. This project showcases my ability to preprocess data, build predictive models, and derive insights from data. 📊

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

The main objective of this project was to predict a car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) based on various features like horsepower, weight, and model year. Along the way, I worked on:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Visualizing data relationships.
- Building and evaluating regression models.

---

## 🛠️ **What I Did**

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Fixed missing values in the `horsepower` column by converting non-numeric values to numeric and filling missing values with the mean.  
   - Adjusted the `model year` column to include the full year (e.g., 1970 instead of 70).  
   
2. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Used scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots to explore the relationships between variables like `weight` and `mpg`.  
   
3. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Built a linear regression model to predict `mpg` based on key features.  
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like R², mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).

## 📚 **Tools Used**

- **Python Libraries**:  
  - 📊 `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
  - 📈 `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotnine` – Data visualization.  
  - ⚙️ `scikit-learn` – Building and evaluating regression models.  

- **IDE**:  
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## ✨ **What I Learned**

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handling missing and non-numeric values.  
  - Rearranging and transforming data for analysis.  

- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Creating scatter matrices, histograms, and boxplots to understand data distributions and relationships.  

- **Model Evaluation**:  
  - Using R², MSE, and MAE to evaluate model performance.
