# 🚗 Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis: Auto MPG 🛠️

Welcome to the **Auto MPG Project**, where I explored predictive modeling and data analysis using the Auto MPG dataset. This project showcases my ability to preprocess data, build predictive models, and derive insights from data. 📊

---

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

The main objective of this project was to predict a car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) based on various features like horsepower, weight, and model year. Along the way, I worked on:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Visualizing data relationships.
- Building and evaluating regression models.

---

## 🛠️ **What I Did**

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Fixed missing values in the `horsepower` column by converting non-numeric values to numeric and filling missing values with the mean.  
   - Adjusted the `model year` column to include the full year (e.g., 1970 instead of 70).  
   
2. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Used scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots to explore the relationships between variables like `weight` and `mpg`.  
   
3. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Built a linear regression model to predict `mpg` based on key features.  
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like R², mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).

## 📚 **Tools Used**

- **Python Libraries**:  
  - 📊 `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
  - 📈 `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotnine` – Data visualization.  
  - ⚙️ `scikit-learn` – Building and evaluating regression models.  

- **IDE**:  
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## ✨ **What I Learned**

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handling missing and non-numeric values.  
  - Rearranging and transforming data for analysis.  

- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Creating scatter matrices, histograms, and boxplots to understand data distributions and relationships.  

- **Model Evaluation**:  
  - Using R², MSE, and MAE to evaluate model performance.

## 🎯 **Outcome**

This project improved my understanding of data preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling. It also reinforced my ability to draw meaningful insights from raw data and communicate them effectively.
